# Chicago Taxi Market Analysis ‚Äî GCP BigQuery + Looker Studio + ML (Fare + Demand Forecasting)

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyses the **Chicago Taxi Trips dataset** (Google BigQuery Public Dataset) to simulate a **market entry strategy for Grab** as it considers expansion into the U.S. market.

Chicago serves as our case study city due to its large population, established ride-hailing demand, and competitive taxi/ride-hailing landscape.

We use:

* **Google BigQuery** for data querying and aggregation
* **Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)** for interactive dashboards and storytelling
* **Google Colab (Python ML models)** for predictive **fare pricing** and **demand forecasting**

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Pretend scenario: **Grab is evaluating entry into the U.S. ride-hailing market, starting with Chicago.**

Key questions:

* What is the current market situation?
* Who are the competitors?
* When is demand strongest?
* Where should Grab focus first?
* How should Grab price its services to compete effectively?
* How can Grab **forecast future demand** to optimize supply?

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

### 1. Fare Prediction Model

Helps Grab estimate **expected fare levels** for any trip.

**Features used:**

* Trip distance (miles)
* Trip duration (seconds)
* Pickup/dropoff location (community area)
* Time features (hour, day of week, month)
* Company (where applicable)

**Target:** `fare`

**Models tested:**

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosted Trees

**Outcome:**

* **Random Forest** achieved the best accuracy (highest R¬≤, lowest RMSE).
* Enables:

  * Optimized **dynamic pricing strategies**
  * Identification of **overpriced/underpriced routes**
  * Smarter **market penetration tactics**

---

### 2. Demand Forecasting Model

Predicts **future trip demand** across time, geography, and conditions.

**Features engineered (via BigQuery + SQL):**

* Temporal: hour, day of week, month, season, holidays
* Geographic: pickup area, dropoff area
* Lagged demand (1-day, 1-week, 1-month)
* Moving averages (7-day, 30-day)
* Volatility metrics
* External factors: rush hour, tourism hotspots, seasonal weather adjustments
* Cyclical time encodings (sin/cos for hour, day, month)

**Target:** `trip_count` (per area √ó hour √ó day)

**Models tested:**

* LightGBM

**Outcome:**

* Captures **demand peaks** (rush hours, weekends, holidays, summer tourism).
* Provides **forecasting insights** for:

  * Driver supply allocation
  * Surge pricing triggers
  * Market entry timing strategy
